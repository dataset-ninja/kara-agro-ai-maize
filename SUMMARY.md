**The KaraAgro AI Maize Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 16552 images with 92934 labeled objects belonging to 8 different classes including *maize streak disease*, *fall armyworm larval damage*, *healthy maize*, and other: *fall armyworm frass*, *fall armyworm larva*, *fall armyworm egg*, *none healthy*, and *healthy images*.

There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Additionally, every image have information about its parent folder: ***faw_01-faw_07***, ***healthy_01-healthy_07***, ***maize_streak_01-maize_streak_07***. The dataset was released in 2022 by the University of Ghana.
