**The KaraAgro AI Maize Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 16552 images with 92934 labeled objects belonging to 8 different classes including *maize streak disease*, *fall armyworm larval damage*, *healthy maize*, and other: *fall armyworm frass*, *fall armyworm larva*, *fall armyworm egg*, *none healthy*, and *healthy images*.

Images in the KaraAgro AI Maize dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 99 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 health statuses: ***maize streak*** (6095 images), ***faw*** (5509 images), and ***healthy*** (4948 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the University of Ghana.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
